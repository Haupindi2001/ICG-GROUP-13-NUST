 Our project however consist of 4 modules which are finance, logistics, human resource and sales relations

Sales relations 
The sales relations is there to fulfill the customer’s needs and preferences in a whole. This module will gather simple information  of the customer like the customer’s ID number for example. After this the customer proceeds with the orders abd the quantity wished. Orders by the customer will be filed and the system will make sure that the products are delivered or on their way and how long they’ll still take to arrive. The system will at all times attend to to undelivered filed products. 
The system will sort that the products will always be available for the customer and stock shortage will not be tolerated.

Logistics 
Bookings
Bookings will be done on a very simple basis. A booking date and the type of  product  will be entered into the system and the delivery date will be provided. If the product happens to not be delivered yet, the system is ought to notify in this instance and the cause of it being late, if the delivery date has been exceeded. This method should and will be as accurate as possible in terms of time so that the customers do not have to wait for long and get frustrated.

Human resource
The human resource module will keep track of everything that’s going on in in reference to work. A manager will be in charge of this and will ensure that all the workers come to work each and every working day. In order to access the adminDashboard the management has to enter username and password. 
The admindashboard will contain information and working records of the employees. If an employee works a certain amount of days in a period, then he or she is ought to obtain a bonus at the end of the period. To determine this, the employeeID will be entered and it will show how many days he or she worked and if the days are enough in order for him or her to obtain a bonus which then the system adds to their monthly salaries. If not then the system should print that the employee has underworked meaning he or she has not worked enough days to obtain a bonus but their normal salary will still be availed to them.
 Workers all have  benefits which will be shown in the employees record of information. 
The daily operations simply involves the time the employee clocks into and out of the working place. This will be a vital record keeping concept in order to determine the productivity of the business and how well they attend to their work. This will also be vital to determine the employees bonuses at the end of the month
Employee management involves hiring and firing of the employees. If a new employee is to be hired then it is a must or a requirement for him or her to go through a training course. This will help to ensure that the new employee is aware of what he or she is doing and will have a basic background of the business. Firing of an employee will require termination of their records with immediate effect and he or she will no longer be part of the business. 

Finance 
In terms of financial services. Income will be calculated on a weekly basis whereby the ordersfilled will be subtracted from the current orders.
Production costs contain all direct costs on materials, manufacturing and labour.
The amount of sales made will be determined by the number of products sold times price per unit. The system should as well print profit if sales are larger than production costs. If the sales are lower than production costs then the system should indicate that a loss was made 
To get the monthly income, the system simply adds the 4 weekly incomes that were calculated earlier.
