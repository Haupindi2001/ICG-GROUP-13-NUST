We were hired by Ayesha Beauty Creation to design and create an application for their daily operations. We created an application for them that shows how well the business is running, to better manage their human resource department and to enable them to be able to better manage their relationship with their customers. In the application there’s a module for the user called admin, which contains the function for the user to login, then we have the module called human resource which keeps track of all the employees who work there, then there’s a module called finances which contains functions such as productionCost for calculating the production cost, salesMade which calculates the amount of money which was made from the sales, a function called monthlyIncome which calculates the amount of money that is made in a month. There’s a module called customer relations which has some functions such as filled_orders which shows which orders have been delivered and vice versa, there’s a function called order_history which shows the orders that have been made over a specified time period. Then there’s a module called logistics, which contains the function called bookings that shows the booking date, product type, delivery date, vehicle number and the location where the products are being delivered.
